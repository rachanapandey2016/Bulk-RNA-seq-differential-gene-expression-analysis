**Project Title: Transcriptomic Signatures in Stage IV Melanoma Patients: Gene Expression Patterns in Long Responders vs. Short Progressors to Immunotherapy**
---  

**Project Description**  
This repository contains the complete analysis pipeline for identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in peripheral **CD4+ T cells** from **Stage IV melanoma patients** who have undergone **immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)** therapy. I performed this analysis as part of a class project for the *Computational Genomics* course at the University of Minnesota.
The project aims to distinguish **long responders** (relapse-free survival >12 months) from **short progressors** (<12 months) based on gene expression signatures using publicly available bulk RNA-seq data.
